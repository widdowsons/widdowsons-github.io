Project Portfolio

This project was built in order to display my skills as a developer. I've used HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS. 

Currently I have an issue with the navigation menu; when the viewport size shrinks under 990px in width, the menu changes into a drop down icon as it should, but no drop down appears when you click it.
This is on my fix it-list.
 ** update, navigation menu works now. Turns out I was missing some source links for Bootstrap/Jquery. 

Still on to do-list: make new pages on the site, add images, readjust padding and make the headline text more appealing when on smaller viewports (now looks a bit heavy).
