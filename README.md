Project Portfolio

This project was built in order to display my skills as a developer. I've used HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS. 

Currently I have an issue with the navigation menu; when the viewport size shrinks under 990px in width, the menu changes into a drop down icon as it should, but no drop down appears when you click it.
This is on my fix it-list.
